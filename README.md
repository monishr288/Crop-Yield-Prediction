# 🌾Crop-Yield-Predictor
### A web-based agricultural tool that predicts crop yields based on environmental and farming parameters, helping farmers make data-driven decisions.
## Yield Prediction:
 * Calculates expected crop production using multiple factors. 
## Multi-Crop Support: 
 * Works with maize, rice, wheat, soybean etc...
## Real-time Calculations: 
 * Instant predictions based on input changes.

## Input Parameters
*  Crop Type: Select from supported crops

*  Rainfall: Measured in millimeters (mm)

*  Soil Fertility: Scale from 0 to 1

* Farm Area: In hectares (ha)

* Temperature: In Celsius (°C)

* Sowing Date: Calendar selection

## Visual Elements
*  Animated Background: Multi-layered waving grass effect

*  Interactive Graph: Chart.js integration showing yield trends


* Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices

*  Agricultural Theme: Green color scheme with natural elements

##  Tech Stack
  * Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

  * Data Visualization: Chart.js

  * Build Tool: Vite

  * Styling: Advanced CSS with animations

## Key Algorithms
* Yield Calculation: Considers rainfall, temperature, soil quality, and crop type

* Optimal Conditions: Different crops have different ideal parameters

* Historical Tracking: Stores and displays past predictions
##  Output Features
* Yield per Hectare: Specific productivity metric

* Total Yield: Overall production based on area

* Monthly Projections: Visual graph showing seasonal variations

* Prediction History: Track previous calculations
## Agricultural Value
* Decision Support: Helps farmers optimize planting strategies

* Risk Management: Identifies potential yield issues early

* Resource Planning: Assists in allocation of water, fertilizers, and labor

* Seasonal Planning: Monthly yield projections for better crop rotation
##  Platform
  * Web Application: Responsive design for all devices

* Offline Capable: Client-side processing

* Cross-Browser: Compatible with modern browsers
  

### This project combines agricultural science with modern web technologies to create a practical tool for farmers and agricultural planners, making yield prediction accessible and visually engaging.
